- **FR-005 Enhanced**: All components and pages MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast (4.5:1 minimum), focus indicators, and ARIA labels for interactive elements.

**Workflow Integration**
- **FR-006 Enhanced**: Users MUST be able to connect form submissions and button clicks to trigger n8n workflows through a workflow connection interface that shows available triggers and allows mapping form fields to workflow inputs.
- **FR-006a**: Every interactive component type (opt-in forms, payment buttons, CTA buttons) MUST have workflow connection capabilities with configurable trigger events.
- **FR-007 Enhanced**: System MUST provide an embedded n8n workflow editor for users to create and customize automation workflows with a simplified interface optimized for marketing automation scenarios.
- **FR-008 Enhanced**: System MUST provide pre-built n8n workflow templates for common integrations: lead capture to email provider, payment processing to access grant, form submission to CRM sync, webinar registration to calendar integration.
- **FR-008a**: Each workflow template MUST include credential management setup and field mapping configuration for the target service.
- **FR-009 Enhanced**: System MUST support integrations with Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Stripe, and PayPal through secure credential storage with API key management and OAuth flows where supported.

**Operations & Reliability**
- **FR-010 Enhanced**: System MUST provide clear status visibility for workflow executions, including successes, failures, and error details through a dashboard showing execution history, error logs, and retry status with timestamps.
- **FR-010a**: Status visibility MUST include real-time execution monitoring with webhook notifications for workflow completion and failure events.
- **FR-011 Enhanced**: System MUST ensure that workflows for different users (tenants) are isolated using n8n project namespaces. Each user gets a dedicated namespace with complete separation of workflows, credentials, and execution history. Users can only see and manage their own namespace resources.
- **FR-011a**: Multi-tenant isolation MUST extend to workflow execution data, credential storage, and execution history with no cross-tenant data access possible.
- **FR-012 Enhanced**: System MUST automatically retry failed workflows up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes) before notifying the user of persistent failures through in-app notifications and email alerts.

### 1.2 Error Handling & Edge Case Requirements

**Error Handling**
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide comprehensive error handling for all external service integrations with clear error messages categorizing service failures, authentication errors, and configuration issues.
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient workflow failures, with configurable retry attempts and timeout periods.
