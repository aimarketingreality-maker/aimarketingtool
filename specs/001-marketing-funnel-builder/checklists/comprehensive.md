## Notes

This comprehensive checklist validates requirements quality across all major domains for the Marketing Funnel Builder feature. Each item tests the requirements themselves for completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurability - not the implementation. Focus areas include UX design, workflow integration, performance, security, accessibility, and compliance requirements.

Items marked [Gap] indicate missing requirements that should be added to the specification.
Items marked [Ambiguity] indicate unclear terms that need more specific definition.
Items marked [Conflict] indicate potential inconsistencies that need resolution.
