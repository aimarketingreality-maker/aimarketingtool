# Feature Specification: Marketing Funnel Builder with n8n Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-marketing-funnel-builder`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Marketing funnel builder with integrated n8n workflow automation platform. Marketers and entrepreneurs need complete sales funnels with backend automation that handles lead capture, email sequences, CRM updates, and payment processing automatically. Core functionality: Users create multi-page funnels (landing page, opt-in page, thank you page, sales page) using marketing-optimized components (hero sections, video embeds, opt-in forms, testimonials, countdown timers, payment buttons, guarantees). Every form submission or button click triggers customizable n8n workflows. n8n Integration: Cloud hybrid deployment where users access custom n8n workflow builder to create and modify automation. Pre-built workflow templates for common scenarios (lead capture to email provider, payment to access grant, form to CRM sync). Critical integrations: Email providers (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign), CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive), Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI tool connections. Funnel templates needed: Lead magnet funnel, webinar registration funnel, product sales funnel, and booking funnel. Each template includes pages and corresponding n8n workflow templates. Users can customize both funnel design and workflow logic through visual editors. Focus on conversion optimization over design perfection. Components must be mobile-responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), and fast-loading. Workflows must be reliable with error handling, retry logic, and clear status visibility. This foundation enables Feature 002 where AI will generate both funnels and workflows from natural language descriptions. Critical: Establish rock-solid architecture for funnel-to-n8n communication, workflow template patterns, and multi-tenant workflow isolation. Competes with GoHighLevel and Simvoly by offering more powerful automation through n8n while being easier to set up than HighLevel. Users should launch complete funnel with working automation in under 1 hour versus 1 day with competitors."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Marketer Creates and Launches a Lead Magnet Funnel (Priority: P1)

A marketer wants to capture leads for a new e-book. They select the "Lead Magnet Funnel" template, which includes a landing page with an opt-in form and a thank you page. The marketer customizes the text and images on both pages using the visual editor. They then connect the opt-in form to their Mailchimp account using a pre-built n8n workflow template, so new subscribers are automatically added to their mailing list. After a quick review, they publish the funnel.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—allowing a user to quickly create a functional, automated funnel. It covers the funnel builder, templates, and basic n8n integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a user creating a new funnel from a template, customizing it, connecting a workflow, and publishing it. The test is successful if a submission to the live funnel's opt-in form correctly adds a contact to the designated email provider.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they select the "Lead Magnet Funnel" template, **Then** a new funnel with a landing page and thank you page is created in their account.
2. **Given** the user is editing the landing page, **When** they drag and drop a "Hero Section" component, **Then** the component is added to the page and can be edited.
3. **Given** the user is configuring the opt-in form, **When** they select the pre-built "Add to Mailchimp" workflow, **Then** they are prompted to provide their Mailchimp API key and list ID.
4. **Given** the funnel is published, **When** a visitor submits the opt-in form, **Then** the visitor's contact information is successfully added to the specified Mailchimp list.

### User Story 2 - Entrepreneur Sells a Product with a Sales Funnel (Priority: P2)

An entrepreneur wants to sell a digital course. They choose the "Product Sales Funnel" template, which includes a sales page, a checkout page, and a confirmation page. They customize the content and connect the payment button on the checkout page to their Stripe account. They use a pre-built n8n workflow to automatically grant access to the course upon successful payment and send a confirmation email.

**Why this priority**: This introduces e-commerce functionality, a critical revenue-generating use case for many marketers and entrepreneurs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a sales funnel, integrating a payment processor, and making a test purchase. The test is successful if the payment is processed and the corresponding automation (e.g., access grant, email) is triggered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has selected the "Product Sales Funnel" template, **When** they add a "Payment Button" to the checkout page, **Then** they can configure it with their Stripe account details and product price.
2. **Given** the funnel is live, **When** a customer clicks the payment button and completes a purchase via Stripe, **Then** the payment is successfully processed.
3. **Given** a successful payment, **When** the corresponding n8n workflow is triggered, **Then** the customer receives access to the course and a confirmation email is sent.

### User Story 3 - Marketer Customizes an n8n Workflow (Priority: P3)

A marketer has a "Booking Funnel" set up to schedule consultation calls. They want to modify the default n8n workflow. After a form is submitted, they want to not only add the lead to their HubSpot CRM but also send a Slack notification to their sales team. The marketer opens the n8n workflow editor, adds a "Slack" node to the existing workflow, configures it with their team's webhook URL, and saves the changes.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the power and flexibility of the integrated n8n platform, which is a key differentiator. It allows users to go beyond pre-built templates for advanced automation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by a user opening the n8n editor for an existing workflow, adding a new node (e.g., a webhook or another supported integration), and saving it. The test is successful if triggering the funnel's action correctly executes the modified workflow, including the newly added step.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a funnel with an n8n workflow, **When** they choose to edit the workflow, **Then** they are taken to a custom n8n workflow builder interface.
2. **Given** the user is in the n8n editor, **When** they drag a new "Slack" node onto the canvas and connect it to the form trigger, **Then** they can configure the node's parameters (e.g., message, channel).
3. **Given** the modified workflow is saved and the funnel is live, **When** a visitor submits the form, **Then** the lead is added to HubSpot AND a notification is sent to the configured Slack channel.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a user tries to publish a funnel with an incompletely configured component (e.g., an opt-in form not linked to a workflow)? The system should show a clear warning.
- How does the system handle a failure in an n8n workflow (e.g., an external API like Mailchimp is down)? The system must log the error, and provide visibility to the user. Retry logic should be implemented for transient errors.
- What happens if a user deletes a component that is connected to a workflow? The system should warn the user about the connected automation before confirming deletion.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What is your preferred git workflow for feature branches and PR creation process? → A: Feature branch → Squash merge to main → Delete feature branch
- Q: Multi-tenant n8n architecture approach for workflow isolation between users? → A: Namespace/project isolation with complete separation of workflows, credentials, and execution history
- Q: Error handling and recovery approach for failed n8n workflows? → A: Auto-retry with escalation - 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min), then notify user
- Q: Component customization scope for users editing funnel templates? → A: Block-based editing with AI agent for larger changes while preventing container-level breaks
